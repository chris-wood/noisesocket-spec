Noise Socket
---------
NoiseSocket is an extension of the Noise Protocol Framework (developed by the authors of Signal and currently used by WhatsApp) that enables quick and seamless Transport Layer Security (TLS) between multiple parties with minimal code space overhead, small keys, and extremely fast speed.
NoiseSocket is designed to overcome the shortcomings of existing TLS implementations and targets IoT devices, microservices, back-end applications such as datacenter-to-datacenter communications, and use cases where third-party certificate of authority infrastructure is not optimal.
